## Exercises:
 * Notebook 1 - Notebook1_ReadingData, In this notebook, we first will read images and their corresponding labels and then will wrap and save them in a single file on disk (or google drive). It helps us a lot later to avoid reading so much data each time when we are working with our models. We will use the python pickle module to wrap images in a single file.
